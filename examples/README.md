# Jekyll::Paginate V2::Examples

Here are a few example sites that use the new jekyll-paginate-v2 gem. They can serve as a help and guide on the nitty gritty details of configuring the gem and leveraging its more advanced features.

Please feel free to fork and play around with this code to quickly test out different scenarios and site structures.

All examples are generated from running the `jekyll new .` command and they all use the [default `minima` theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

## Example 1: Typical Blog

## Example 2: Category Pagination
Car site that has multiple paginated pages and multiple post categories.

## Example 3: Tag Pagination
